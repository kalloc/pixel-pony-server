# Pixel Pony

Pixel Pony is a Node.js server that generates unique and random pixelated images of ponies.

## Usage

To use Pixel Pony, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you've cloned this repository, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```


By default, the server will run on port 3000. You can access the pony images by visiting `http://localhost:3000/pony`.

You can also set the `PORT` and `HOST` environment variables to specify the port and host for the server to run on. For example:

```bash
PORT=8080 HOST=localhost npm start
```

This will start the server on port 8080 and only allow connections from `localhost`.
